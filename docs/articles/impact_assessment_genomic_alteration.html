<p>In this vignette we will explore the use of the CIBRA impact score to
assess the impact of a genomic alteration.</p>

<p>In this example we will only focus on 6 genes: the tumor suppressor
genes APC and TP53, the oncogenes KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA and the often
mutated gene TTN in colorectal cancer.</p>

<p>You can provide a larger definition matrix and indicate which columns
to test in CIBRA. The number of permutation iterations to perform is
recommended to be 50 to give an indication of the intrinsic variation in
the dataset given the size of cases and control. However to make the
example run quicker we have set it to 0 which turns of the internal
permutation.</p>

<p>The results are reported as the tested definition (def), which are
SNVs in this case, the column assessed (col) which is the gene we have
assessed. The proportion and significant area (sign_area) are the impact
measures reported. The number of cases (investigated) and controls are
reported. Moreover, if the iterations where not set to 0, the average
permutation signal measures and the standard deviation would have been
reported.</p>

<p>When performing the permutation test or the gamma fitted estimate,
additional columns with the p-values will be added to the results.
“perm_test_prop” and “perm_test_sign_area” are the p-values generated
