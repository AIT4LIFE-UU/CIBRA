\textbf{abstract}
Cancer is characterized by genomic instability. Identifying which somatic alterations have a high impact on tumor biology is a challenging task. We developed CIBRA, a computational method that determines the system-wide impact of genomic alterations on tumor biology by integrating genomics with transcriptomics data. The performance of CIBRA was evaluated by a genome-wide screen in 33 cancer types using data from primary and metastatic cancer. CIBRA successfully confirmed the impact of point mutations in experimentally validated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.  Moreover, CIBRA identified many novel genes affected by structural variants with a significant system-wide impact on tumor biology similar to known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. CIBRA can identify both the impactful mutation types and subregions of genes requiring only 10 cases and controls. In this way, CIBRA enables prioritization of genomic alterations in silico that warrant further experimental validation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CIBRA from [GitHub](https://github.com/nayfous/CIBRA) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nayfous/CIBRA")
```

## Example
For extensive examples of the utility of CIBRA, please consult the vignettes.


```{r load data}
# load functions
library(CIBRA)
library(BiocParallel)

# load transcription data and genomic alterations from TCGA COADREAD
count_data <- CIBRA::TCGA_CRC_rna_data
mutation_profile <- CIBRA::TCGA_CRC_non_silent_mutation_profile
```

## Prepare a definition matrix for analysis which indicates which samples are cases and controls.
In this example we will only focus on 6 genes: the tumor suppressor genes APC and TP53, the oncogenes KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA and 
the often mutated gene TTN in colorectal cancer.

```{r prepare definition matrix}
# prepare data for CIBRA

# select genes of interest
goi <- c("APC", "TP53", "KRAS", "BRAF", "PIK3CA")

# filter mutation profile for only selected genes
definition_matrix <- mutation_profile[goi]

# fix sample names for intersect between the two datatypes
rownames(definition_matrix) <- stringr::str_replace_all(rownames(definition_matrix), "-", ".")

# select intersect between definition matrix and count data
sample_list <- intersect(rownames(definition_matrix), colnames(count_data))

# select data and definition matrix as the intersect
count_data <- count_data[sample_list]
definition_matrix <- definition_matrix[sample_list,]

# show definition matrix
knitr::kable(head(definition_matrix))
```

## Set the parameters to use with CIBRA and run CIBRA. 
You can provide a larger definition matrix and indicate which columns to test in CIBRA.
The number of permutation iterations to perform is recommended to be 50 to give an indication of the intrinsic variation in the dataset given the size of cases and control. 
However to make the example run quicker we have set it to 0 which turns of the internal permutation. 

```{r run CIBRA}
# focus on APC
columns <- goi

# set up parameters for CIBRA
control_definition <- "WT" # reference condition
confidence <- 0.1 # confidence threshold for the proportion calculation
# set permutation to 0 to skip permutations
iterations = 0 # number of permutation iterations to be performed per condition

register(SnowParam(4)) # set number of cores to be used

# run CIBRA with default DE analysis method (DESeq2)
CIBRA_res <- run_CIBRA(count_data, as.data.frame(definition_matrix), 
                       columns = columns, 
                       control_definition = control_definition, 
                       confidence = confidence, 
                       iterations = iterations, 
                       parallel = TRUE)
```

If the iterations where not set to 0, the average permutation signal measures and the standard deviation would have been reported.

```{r results}
# print the report table
knitr::kable(CIBRA_res$CIBRA_results)
```

## Assess significance of the signal measures

```{r permutation testing}
# calculate the pvalue by comparing to a reference distribution generated with DESeq2
perm_data <- CIBRA::perm_dist_crc_tcga

# use the gamma test to also calculate a fitted p-value
CIBRA_res_stat <-  permutation_test(CIBRA_res$CIBRA_results, perm_data, test = "gamma")

# print the report table
knitr::kable(CIBRA_res_stat$results)
```

## visualize the results

```{r visualize}
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)
require(scales)

# visualize the results
plot_data <- CIBRA_res_stat$results %>% select(col, investigated, control, sign_area, 
                                 pvalue_sign_area)

p <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(y = as.numeric(sign_area), 
                          x = factor(col), fill = pvalue_sign_area)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = as.numeric(investigated)/(as.numeric(investigated) 
                                                  + as.numeric(control))*100), 
             shape = 21, 
             color = "black", stroke = 1.5) +
  ylab("CIBRA impact score (Significant Area)") + xlab("") + 
  scale_fill_continuous('p-value', low = "#ffffcc", high = "#800026", 
                        breaks = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 1),
                        trans = compose_trans("log10", "reverse"),
                        limits = c(1,0.00001)) +
  scale_size_area(name = "Cases (%)", 
                  breaks = c(25, 50, 75, 100),
                  limit = c(0,100), max_size = 8) +
  ylim(c(0,0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(size = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE, override.aes=list(fill = "darkgrey")))

print(p)
